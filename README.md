# MIPS-CPU
- A MIPS CPU simulator in Java
- This project gets a text file in zeros and ones ( binary ) as instructions and data and executes the instructions as a MIPS Processor.

## About
This project was designed in two phases by [Ms. Atousa Jafari](linkedin.com/in/atousa-jafari-585030144) and [Ms.Mohadese Nikseresh](linkedin.com/in/mohaddaseh-nikseresht), the TAs of the course, as the final project of _Computer Architecture Design_ under supervision of [Dr.S.Mohammadreza Moosavi](linkedin.com/in/mohammad-moosavi-357b2b33).

The documentation of each phase is provided in its own repository but to summarize, the source code is written in _Java_ and its job is simulation 32-bit MIPS CPU in a 5-stage Pipeline.
